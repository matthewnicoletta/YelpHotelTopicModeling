# Yelp Hotel Reviews Topic Modeling & Text Analytics Projetct

Start here: <a href="https://www.matthewnicoletta.com/Yelp_Hotel_NLP.html">https://www.matthewnicoletta.com/Yelp_Hotel_NLP.html</a>

## Summary
This is a Jupyter Notebook-based project in Python that uses topic modeling and other text analytics techniques to glean insights from Yelp Hotel reviews. The goal of the project was to identify key customer experiences driving both positive and negative reviews. 

## Project Files - Where to Start
This repository contains:

1. Yelp_Hotel_NLP.ipynb - a Jupyter Notebook file, containing the Python code used to perform the textual analysis
2. Yelp_Hotel_NLP.html - an HTML-based output of that Jupyter
3. Yelp review data dictionary

The actual data file is a SQLite3 .db that is too large to upload to a standard github repo, can be viewed/downloaded from dropbox here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qfcq7byvfelfdqw/yelp_hotel.db?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/qfcq7byvfelfdqw/yelp_hotel.db?dl=0</a>.

*Start with the HTML file, which shows both the code and the output, including interactive visualizations: <a href="https://www.matthewnicoletta.com/Yelp_Hotel_NLP.html">https://www.matthewnicoletta.com/Yelp_Hotel_NLP.html</a>*

## Data Source & Methodology
The data source includes Yelp reviews for many venues/services that are NOT hotels, so some filtering was required. 

Note that this was a team project, for which I wrote 90% of the code.
